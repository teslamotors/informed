### Fixed

## 2.0.2 (Feb 13, 2019)

### Fixed

## 2.0.1 (Feb 10, 2019)

### Fixed
- Issue where render and component props were getting passed to the dom form

## 2.0.0 (Feb 7, 2019)

### Added
- useFieldApi
- useFieldState
- useFormApi
- useFormState
- useField
- format
- parse
- maintianCursor ( fixes issue where cursor jumps to end on mask )
- ArrayField ( Check out the docs! this is sick! )
- Form Level validation ( function that can invalidate the form as a whole )
- debug prop that allows you to visually view the rendering!

### Changed

- the field `"siblings.1"` now resolves to `values.siblings[1]`, it used to resolve to `values.siblings.1`
- the field `"siblings['2']"` now resolves to `values.siblings[2]`, it used to resolve to `values.siblings.2`
- withFormApi will no longer trigger a rerender if the fomrs state changes. This is a great optimization for those who want to modify but dont care about the form state!
- the `validate` prop now expects the validation function to return `undefined` if there is no error. Any other returned value (including falsey `null`, `0`, etc will be treated as an error for the field.

### Removed

- The Field Component
- `fieldExists` not needed
- `setState` will maybe add later but its complex and out of scope ATM
- `setValues` will maybe add later but its complex and out of scope ATM ( as of V 2.0.3 its back! )
- `preSubmit` was never needed.. developers can do this themselves
- Async Validation. Async validation led to many issues that overcomplicated `informed`. We determined this is something that the developer could achive on there own for now but we may look into adding this in the future.

### Changed

**
Note: this was the first release but i wanted to include changes from
`react-form` so here they are:
**

- `formApi` was split into two parts `formApi` ( contains just functions ) `formState` ( contains just form state )
- Form level validation is gone. You do all validation via field validation.
- `defaultValues` Form prop is now called `initialValues`
- `onChange` Form prop only recieves the `formState`. It used to retrieve the form Api as well.
- `preventDefault` Form prop is now `dontPreventDefault`
- `getApi` Form prop just returns the formApi, not the state and the api.
- `Form` component now renders the `form` element internally. So you dont have to "hook it up" anymore!!

### Removed

**
Note: this was the first release but i wanted to include things that were removed from
`react-form` so here they are:
**

- `NestedField` you can use `Scope` instead but all it does is scope internal fields to `scope="your-scope"`
- validateOnSubmit was removed. Now the form always validates on submit by default and you can opt into sooner validation at field level.
- `defaultValues` form prop is now called `initialValues`
- `pure` Form prop. Its not needed anymore due to the use of `React.PureComponent` internally.
- add, remove, and swap values. The developer can achive this on there own without the use of internal functionality.
- Array Syntax. In order to keep things simple we now only support the string syntax for field names.
- Async Validation. Async validation led to many issues that overcomplicated `react-form`. We determined this is something that the developer could achive on there own for now but we may look into adding this in the future.
- Warning and Success have been removed for now to keep lib lean but we may add additional functions in the future.
