showError } = fieldState;\\n\\n  // The field control\\n  const { setValue, setTouched } = fieldApi;\\n\\n  // Everything else\\n  const { label, id, ...rest } = userProps;\\n\\n  return render(\\n

To get\\nmore granular validation, simply pass in `validateOn` props.\\n\\nSee table below for mapping:\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n| validateOn    | derived       | change       | blur         | submit       | default |\\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------- |\\n| change        | change-change | sync + async | sync + async | sync + async |         |\\n| blur          | blur-blur     | x            | sync + async | sync + async | x       |\\n| change-blur   | change-blur   | sync         | sync + async | sync + async |         |\\n| change-submit | change-submit | sync         | sync         | sync + async |         |\\n| blur-submit   | submit-submit | x            | sync         | sync + async |         |\\n| submit        | submit-submit | x            | x            | sync + async |         |\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nValidation is controlled via the `validateOn` prop, but in order to control when it shows,\\nuse the `showErrorIfError` and `showErrorIfDirty` props. **This is because sometimes you may want the form to be invalid but not show the error to the user yet ( default is `showErrorIfTouched` )**\\n\\n| prop               | description                                                                                                  | default |\\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |\\n| showErrorIfError   | will set `showError` for that field to true whenever there is an error (typically used with validateOnMount) |         |\\n| showErrorIfTouched | will set `showError` for that field to true whenever there is an error and the field is touched              | x       |\\n| showErrorIfDirty   | will set `showError` for that field to true whenever there is an error and the field is dirty                |         |\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nFinally we have a use case for validating right away ( on mount )\\n\\n| prop            | description                     | default |\\n| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |\\n| validateOnMount |

This is a great optimization for those who want to modify but dont care about the form state!\\n- the `validate` prop now expects the validation function to return `undefined` if there is no error. Any other returned value (including falsey `null`, `0`, etc will be treated as an error for the field.\\n\\n### Removed\\n\\n- The Field Component\\n- `fieldExists` not needed\\n- `setState` will maybe add later but its complex and out of scope ATM\\n- `setValues` will maybe add later but its complex and out of scope ATM ( as of V 2.0.3 its back! )\\n- `preSubmit` was never needed.. developers can do this themselves\\n- Async Validation. Async validation led to many issues that overcomplicated `informed`. We determined this is something that the developer could achive on there own for now but we may look into adding this in the future.\\n\\n## 1.10.12 ( December 4, 2018 )\\n\\n### Updated\\n\\n-

so you can add a button with type=reset and it will reset the form\\n\\n## 1.2.0 ( June 27, 2018 )\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- validateOnMount to input props\\n\\n## 1.1.2 ( June 25, 2018 )\\n\\n### Moved\\n\\n- React and React-Dom to dev dependencies\\n\\n## 1.1.1 ( June 18, 2018 )\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Bug where i did not do null check on event within on submit\\n\\n## 1.0.1 ( June 15, 2018 )\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Notify prop to inputs that allows you to notify other fields when your error state changes ( see docs )\\n\\n## 1.0.0 (June 12, 2018)\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Text\\n- TextArea\\n- Radio Group\\n- Radio\\n- Select\\n- Select as Multiselect !!!\\n- Checkbox\\n- withRadioGroup\\n- withFieldApi\\n- withFieldState\\n- withFormApi\\n- withFormState\\n- asField\\n- Form\\n- Field\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n**\\nNote: this was the first release but i wanted to include changes from\\n`react-form` so here they are:\\n**\\n\\n- `formApi` was split into two parts `formApi` ( contains just functions ) `formState` ( contains just form state )\\n- Form level validation is gone. You do all validation via field validation.\\n- `defaultValues` Form prop is now called `initialValues`\\n- `onChange` Form prop only recieves the `formState`. It used to retrieve the form Api as well.\\n- `preventDefault` Form prop is now `dontPreventDefault`\\n- `getApi` Form prop just returns the formApi, not the state and the api.\\n- `Form` component now renders the `form` element internally. So you dont have to \\\"hook it up\\\" anymore!!\\n\\n### Removed\\n\\n**\\nNote: this was the first release but i wanted to include things that were removed from\\n`react-form` so here they are:\\n**\\n\\n- `NestedField` you can use `Scope` instead but all it does is scope internal fields to `scope=\\\"your-scope\\\"`\\n- validateOnSubmit was removed. Now the form always validates on submit by default and you can opt into sooner validation at field level.\\n- `defaultValues` form prop is now called `initialValues`\\n- `pure` Form prop. Its not needed anymore due to the use of `React.PureComponent` internally.\\n- add, remove, and swap values. The developer can achive this on there own without the use of internal functionality.\\n- Array Syntax. In order to keep things simple we now only support the string syntax for field names.\\n- Async Validation. Async validation led to many issues that overcomplicated `react-form`. We determined this is something that the developer could achive on there own for now but we may look into adding this in the future.\\n- Warning and Success have been removed for now to keep lib lean but we may add additional functions in the future.\\n\";","\"use strict\";\n\nvar _frameworkImportPath = require(\"@storybook/react\");\n\n/* eslint-disable import/no-unresolved */\n(0, _frameworkImportPath.configure)([require.context('./stories', false, /^\\.[\\\\/](?:index\\.js)$/)], module, false);","// Imports\nvar ___CSS_LOADER_API_IMPORT___ = require(\"../../node_modules/@storybook/builder-webpack4/node_modules/css-loader/dist/runtime/api.js\");\nexports = ___CSS_LOADER_API_IMPORT___(false);\n// Module\nexports.push([module.id, \"/*! normalize.css v3.0.2 | MIT License | git.io/normalize */\\n\\n/**\\n * 1.

default \"# Dynamic Form\\n\\nOften you need to \\\"pull the rug\\\" out from under a form and dynamically change\\nthe contents. This is easily achieved with informed. Below is an example of three\\ninputs, and three toggle buttons. The first two inputs are basically the same but are\\nsimply toggled in two different ways ( same result different code ). The third one\\nis special because it has an additional \\\"keep-state\\\" prop.\\n\\nDo this! Enter somthing in the first and second fields, then hit the first two toggle buttons.\\nNotice how the old values are removed from the form state, and the fields are updated. Sometimes,\\nthis is what a developer wants! When they change the field they want the old value to go away. BUT!\\nsometimes this is not what a developer wants. Instead, they may want a fields value to stick around.\\nIn order to achive this, you simply tell informed to \\\"keep the state\\\".\\n\\nDo this now! Enter somthing in the third field and hit the third toggle button. Enter a new value in the empty field,\\nand then toggle again! You can see how the value persisted!\\n\\n<!-- STORY -->\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\\nimport { Form, Input, useFieldState } from 'informed';\\n\\nconst JoesState = () => {\\n  const fieldState = useFieldState('joe');\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <strong>Joes State</strong>\\n      <pre>\\n        <code>{JSON.stringify(fieldState, null, 2)}</code>\\n      </pre>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nconst ElonsState = () => {\\n  const fieldState = useFieldState('elon');\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <strong>Elons State</strong>\\n      <pre>\\n        <code>{JSON.stringify(fieldState, null, 2)}</code>\\n      </pre>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nconst DynamicForm = () => {\\n  const [field1, setField1] = useState('foo');\\n  const [field2, setField2] = useState('baz');\\n  const [field3, setField3] = useState('boo');\\n  const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(true);\\n  const [field5, setField5] = useState('joe');\\n\\n  const toggle1 = () => {\\n    setField1(field1 === 'foo' ?

By accessing the `formState` as a parameter to a child render function via `FormStateAccess`.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<Form validate={validateForm}>\\n  <label>\\n    First name:\\n    <Input name=\\\"name\\\" validate={validate} />\\n  </label>\\n  <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n  <label>State:</label>\\n  <FormStateAccessor>\\n    {formState => (\\n      <pre>\\n        <code>{JSON.stringify(formState, null, 2)}</code>\\n      </pre>\\n    )}\\n  </FormStateAccessor>\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n<br/>\\n2) By accessing the `formState` via Hooks!\\n<br/>\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst FormState = () => {\\n  const formState = useFormState();\\n  return (\\n    <label>Values:</label>\\n    <code>{JSON.stringify(formState.values)}</code>\\n    <label>Touched:</label>\\n    <code>{JSON.stringify(formState.touched)}</code>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\n<Form>\\n  <div>\\n    <Input field=\\\"hello\\\" />\\n    <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n    <Debug />\\n  </div>\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n3. By accessing the `formState` as a parameter to a child render function.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<Form>\\n  {({ formState }) => (\\n    <div>\\n      <Input field=\\\"hello\\\" />\\n      <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n      <label>Values:</label>\\n      <code>{JSON.stringify(formState.values)}</code>\\n      <label>Touched:</label>\\n      <code>{JSON.stringify(formState.touched)}</code>\\n    </div>\\n  )}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n<br/>\\nSo if you do need access to the form state, any of these methods will work.\\n\\n### Ok so what if i need the state outside of the `<Form />` ??\\n\\nDon't fret! This is also very simple. You have two options:\\n\\n1. Use the Forms `onChange` prop.\\n\\n  <br/>\\n\\n```jsx\\n<Form onChange={formState => console.log(formState)}>\\n  <Input field=\\\"hello\\\" />\\n  <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n  <br/>\\n  2. Use the Forms `formApiRef` prop, and then use the apis `getFormState` function.\\n  <br/>\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react';\\nimport { Form, Input } from 'informed';\\n\\nconst MyAwesomeForm = () => {\\n  const formApiRef = useRef();\\n\\n  const handleClick = () => {\\n    console.log(formApiRef.current.getFormState());\\n  };\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <Form formApiRef={formApiRef}>\\n        <Input name=\\\"hello\\\" />\\n        <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n      </Form>\\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Print Form State</button>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\";","import React from 'react';\nimport readme from './README.md';\nimport withDocs from '../../utils/withDocs';\n\nimport { Form, Input, FormStateAccessor } from '../../../src';\n\nconst validate = value => {\n  return !value || value.length < 5\n    ?

This design allows you to define your very own Input types if the defaults don't suite your needs! For additional information on custom Inputs, see the custom input section. If you are just getting started, or don't care to create your own custom inputs, simply take a look at the included input types.\\n\\n## Input Props\\n\\nBelow are all the input props that `informed`'s inputs accept.\\n\\n| Name                | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\\n| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| name                | string | YES      | Every input must have a name.

In its simplest form, field names are just strings. However, sometimes you may have some complex forms that require special ways of organizing your fields, this is where the special syntax comes in.\\n\\nFields can be simple strings, strings that contain \\\".\\\", and strings that contain \\\"[ ]\\\", much like how you access and write to objects and arrays in javascript. Below are some examples of field names and what they resolve to in the forms values object.\\n\\n| Field                  | Resolution               |\\n| ---------------------- |

Use the Forms `onChange` prop.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<Form onChange={formState => console.log(formState)}>\\n  <Input name=\\\"hello\\\" />\\n  <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n<br/>\\n2) Use the Forms `formApiRef` prop, and then use the apis `getFormState` function.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react';\\nimport { Form, Input } from 'informed';\\n\\nconst MyAwesomeForm = () => {\\n  const formApiRef = useRef();\\n\\n  const handleClick = () => {\\n    console.log(apiRef.current.getFormState());\\n  };\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <Form formApiRef={formApiRef}>\\n        <Input name=\\\"hello\\\" />\\n        <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n      </Form>\\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Print Form State</button>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\n<br />\\n\";","import React from 'react';\nimport withDocs from '../../utils/withDocs';\nimport readme from './README.md';\nimport { Form, Input, useFormState, Debug } from '../../../src';\n\nconst FormState = () => {\n  const formState = useFormState();\n\n  return (\n    <pre>\n      <code>{JSON.stringify(formState, null, 2)}</code>\n    </pre>\n  );\n};\n\nconst Example = () => {\n  return (\n    <Form>\n      <Input name=\"name\" label=\"First Name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n      <Debug />\n    </Form>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default withDocs(readme, Example);\n","export default \"## Having Fun\\n\\nAlright its time to have some fun! The code below is all you need to get\\nstarted. Go ahead and play around with the form below, check out the code\\nsnippet, and then you can read about what the heck is going on.\\n\\n**Hint:** type 2 or three characters and click submit and take a look at the state represented on the right.\\n\\n<!-- STORY -->\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { Form, Input } from 'informed';\\n\\nconst validate = value => {\\n  if (!value || value.length < 5)\\n    return 'Field must be at least five characters';\\n};\\n\\nconst submit = ({ values }) =>\\n  window.alert(`Form successfully submitted with ${JSON.stringify(values)}`);\\n\\n<Form onSubmit={submit}>\\n  <Input name=\\\"name\\\" label=\\\"First name\\\" validate={validate} />\\n  <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n</Form>;\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n**Ok so what the Foo is going on?**\\n\\nIts actually pretty simple!\\n\\nInformed takes care of managing form state so you don't have to! Basically\\nit hooks up the native `onChange`, `onBlur`, and `onSubmit` functions and keeps track of\\nall sorts of stuff based on those changes. This example uses the `<Text>` and `<Form>` components\\nfrom informed, but under the hood they are literally just `<input>` and `<form>` dom elements.\\nSo you can pass anything down to them as usual! **For example:** `<Input field=\\\"name\\\" style={{color: 'green'}}>`\\n\\n<br/>\\n\";","import React from 'react';\nimport Code from '../../utils/Code';\nimport withDocs from
