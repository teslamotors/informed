### Breaking changes

#### onSubmit signature

Old

```
const onSubmit = values => console.log( values );
```

New

```
const onSubmit = formState => console.log( formState.values );
```

#### Text --> Input

Old

```jsx
<Text field="name" />
```

New

```jsx
<Input name="name" />
```

#### apiRef --> formApiRef

New

```jsx
<Form formApiRef={formApiRef} />
```

```
informed:props is now ui:props when using schema based forms
```

#### `asField` has been removed

Instead of doing this

```js
const CustomField = asField({ fieldState, fieldApi }) => {}
```

Do this

```js
const CustomField = props => {
  const { fieldState, fieldApi } = useField(props);
};
```

#### Relevance

The when function for relevance now has this signature

```
when={({formState, formApi, scope}) => {...} }
```

#### yupSchema

```
validationSchema ---> is now yupSchema
```

#### Array Fields

##### Renamed `field` to `name`

```jsx
<ArrayField.Items>
  {({ remove, field }) => (
    <>
      <Input name={field} />
      <button type="button" onClick={remove}>
        Remove
      </button>
    </>
  )}
</ArrayField.Items>
```

Is Now

```jsx
<ArrayField.Items>
  {({ remove, name }) => (

      <Input name={name} />
      <button type="button" onClick={remove}>
        Remove
      </button>
    </>
  )}
</ArrayField.Items>
```

##### No more array field path prefixing

Old:

```jsx
<ArrayField.Items>
  {({ remove, field }) => (
    <>
      <Input name={`${field}.name`} />
      <Input name={`${field}.age`} />
      <button type="button" onClick={remove}>
        Remove
      </button>
    </>
  )}
</ArrayField.Items>
```

New:

```jsx
<ArrayField.Items>
  {({ remove }) => (
    <>
      <Input name="name" />
      <Input name="age" />
      <button type="button" onClick={remove}>
        Remove
      </button>
    </>
  )}
</ArrayField.Items>
```

##### No more values in array field render prop

Old:

```jsx
// Some component you need to use state of array field item
const FieldState = ({ values }) => {
  return (
    <pre>
      <code>{JSON.stringify(values, null, 2)}</code>
    </pre>
  );
};

<ArrayField.Items>
  {({ remove, values }) => (
    <>
      <Input name="name" />
      <Input name="age" />
      <FieldState values={values} />
      <button type="button" onClick={remove}>
        Remove
      </button>
    </>
  )}
</ArrayField.Items>;
```

New:

```jsx
// Some component you need to use state of array field item
const FieldState = () => {
  const { values } = useArrayFieldItemState();
  return (
    <pre>
      <code>{JSON.stringify(values, null, 2)}</code>
    </pre>
  );
};

<ArrayField.Items>
  {({ remove }) => (
    <>
      <Input name="name" />
      <Input name="age" />
      <FieldState />
      <button type="button" onClick={remove}>
        Remove
      </button>
    </>
  )}
</ArrayField.Items>;
```

#### Debugging with `<FormState />`

Old:

```jsx
<FormState values errors />
```

New:

```jsx
<Debug values errors />
```

#### Custom Inputs

Minor changes to custom inputs

New:

```jsx
const CustomInput = props => {
  const { fieldState, fieldApi, render, ref, userProps } = useField(props);

  // The field state
  const { value, error, showError } = fieldState;

  // The field control
  const { setValue, setTouched } = fieldApi;

  // Everything else
  const { label, id, ...rest } = userProps;

  return render(
    <>
      {label ? <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label> : null}
      <input
        {...rest}
        id={id}
        ref={ref}
        value={!value && value !== 0 ? '' : value}
        onChange={e => {
          setValue(e.target.value, e);
        }}
        onBlur={e => {
          setTouched(true, e);
        }}
        style={showError ? { border: 'solid 1px red' } : null}
      />
      {showError ? <small style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</small> : null}
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Validation

Validation is now controlled via validateOn="validationString"

By default fields will only validate on blur. To get
more granular validation, simply pass in `validateOn` props.

See table below for mapping:

<br />

| validateOn    | derived       | change       | blur         | submit       | default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------- |
| change        | change-change | sync + async | sync + async | sync + async |         |
| blur          | blur-blur     | x            | sync + async | sync + async | x       |
| change-blur   | change-blur   | sync         | sync + async | sync + async |         |
| change-submit | change-submit | sync         | sync         | sync + async |         |
| blur-submit   | submit-submit | x            | sync         | sync + async |         |
| submit        | submit-submit | x            | x            | sync + async |         |

<br />

Validation is controlled via the `validateOn` prop, but in order to control when it shows,
use the `showErrorIfError` and `showErrorIfDirty` props. **This is because sometimes you may want the form to be invalid but not show the error to the user yet ( default is `showErrorIfTouched` )**

| prop               | description                                                                                                  | default |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| showErrorIfError   | will set `showError` for that field to true whenever there is an error (typically used with validateOnMount) |         |
| showErrorIfTouched | will set `showError` for that field to true whenever there is an error and the field is touched              | x       |
| showErrorIfDirty   | will set `showError` for that field to true whenever there is an error and the field is dirty                |         |

<br />

Finally we have a use case for validating right away ( on mount )

| prop            | description                     | default |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| validateOnMount | will trigger validation onMount | false   |

<br />

- debug prop that allows you to visually view the rendering!

### Changed

- the field `"siblings.1"` now resolves to `values.siblings[1]`, it used to resolve to `values.siblings.1`
- the field `"siblings['2']"` now resolves to `values.siblings[2]`, it used to resolve to `values.siblings.2`
- withFormApi will no longer trigger a rerender if the fomrs state changes. This is a great optimization for those who want to modify but dont care about the form state!
- the `validate` prop now expects the validation function to return `undefined` if there is no error. Any other returned value (including falsey `null`, `0`, etc will be treated as an error for the field.

### Removed

- The Field Component
- `fieldExists` not needed
- `setState` will maybe add later but its complex and out of scope ATM
- `setValues` will maybe add later but its complex and out of scope ATM ( as of V 2.0.3 its back! )
- `preSubmit` was never needed.. developers can do this themselves
- Async Validation. Async validation led to many issues that overcomplicated `informed`. We determined this is something that the developer could achive on there own for now but we may look into adding this in the future.

### Changed

**
Note: this was the first release but i wanted to include changes from
`react-form` so here they are:
**

- `formApi` was split into two parts `formApi` ( contains just functions ) `formState` ( contains just form state )
- Form level validation is gone. You do all validation via field validation.
- `defaultValues` Form prop is now called `initialValues`
- `onChange` Form prop only recieves the `formState`. It used to retrieve the form Api as well.
- `preventDefault` Form prop is now `dontPreventDefault`
- `getApi` Form prop just returns the formApi, not the state and the api.
- `Form` component now renders the `form` element internally. So you dont have to "hook it up" anymore!!

### Removed

**
Note: this was the first release but i wanted to include things that were removed from
`react-form` so here they are:
**

- `NestedField` you can use `Scope` instead but all it does is scope internal fields to `scope="your-scope"`
- validateOnSubmit was removed. Now the form always validates on submit by default and you can opt into sooner validation at field level.
- `defaultValues` form prop is now called `initialValues`
- `pure` Form prop. Its not needed anymore due to the use of `React.PureComponent` internally.
- add, remove, and swap values. The developer can achive this on there own without the use of internal functionality.
- Array Syntax. In order to keep things simple we now only support the string syntax for field names.
- Async Validation. Async validation led to many issues that overcomplicated `react-form`. We determined this is something that the developer could achive on there own for now but we may look into adding this in the future.
- Warning and Success have been removed for now to keep lib lean but we may add additional functions in the future.
