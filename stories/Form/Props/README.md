| dontPreventDefault | bool         | The default is to always "preventDefault" when a form submits. Pass this to disable "preventingDefault". You would, for example, pass this in when you want to use a good old form submission using action="/foo.php" on your form.                                                                                                 |
| getApi             | func         | To retrieve the form api as a callback, you can pass a function to the `getApi` prop. Your function will be called with the formApi as the only parameter. You can save this as a reference to easily manipulate your form from outside of the form scope. Note: this is no different then using a ref in react ( same principle ). |

Function will receive the errors.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| validate           | func         | Function that gets called when form is attempting to submit.

Function accepts the values as a parameter and must return an object where the key is the field and the value is an error or undefined                                                                                                                                                                         |
| allowEmptyStrings     | bool         | Enable empty strings in the form values ( by default when you backspace everything in a text field it will remove the value from the values )                                                                                                                                                             |
