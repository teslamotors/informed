| component          | node         | A React component that is given the `formApi` and `formState` as props                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| render             | func         | A render function that is given the `formApi` and `formState` as props                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| onSubmit           | func         | A function that gets called when form is submitted successfully. The function receives the values as a parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| preSubmit          | func         | Function that is a value filter that happens after validation, and before a successful submission. Use it to scrub and/or clean your values before they are submitted. **WARNING**: Whatever you return will replace all of the values in that form's state and then be passed to the onSubmit method.                                      |
| initialValues      | obj          | Use this if you want to populate the form with initial values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| onChange           | func         | Function that gets called when form updates. Function receives the formState as a parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| onValueChange      | func         | Function that gets called when forms values change. Function receives the values as a parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| dontPreventDefault | bool         | The default is to always "preventDefault" when a form submits. Pass this to disable "preventingDefault". You would, for example, pass this in when you want to use a good old form submission using action="/foo.php" on your form.                                                                                                 |
| getApi             | func         | To retrieve the form api as a callback, you can pass a function to the `getApi` prop. Your function will be called with the formApi as the only parameter. You can save this as a reference to easily manipulate your form from outside of the form scope. Note: this is no different then using a ref in react ( same principle ). |
| onSubmitFailure    | func         | Function that gets called when submission fails due to errors. Function will receive the errors as a first parameter and asyncErrors as a second parameter.                                                                                                                                                                         |
